- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mjholub
- Iâ€™m mostly into backend programming, especially in context of decentralized systems and technologies, such as ActivityPub or IPFS. But I like writing me some lightweight and elegant frontend from time to time :)
- I use Go often for my personal project for performance reasons mostly, but I like the DX of Elixir and Clojure even more.
