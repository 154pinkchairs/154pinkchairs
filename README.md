- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mjholub
- Iâ€™m mostly into backend and systems programming, especially in context of decentralized systems and technologies, such as ActivityPub or IPFS.
- Big fan of functional and reactive programming
- I use Go often for my personal project for efficiency reasons mostly. In terms of technologies that I see as the reclaimers of joy of coding, I'd name Clojure, Scala, Elixir, F#, Rust and Bun with libs like marble.js, Elysia, RxJS, fp-ts or vixeny.
