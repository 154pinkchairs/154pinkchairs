- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mjholub
- Iâ€™m mostly into backend and systems programming, especially in context of decentralized systems and technologies, such as ActivityPub or IPFS.
- Big fan of functional and reactive programming
- I use Go often for my personal project for efficiency reasons mostly. But coding in Clojure, Elixir and Scala is most enjoyable to me, actually.
